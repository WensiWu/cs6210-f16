\section{Logistics}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Our enrollment is at 50, and there are still a few students who want
  to get in.  We only have 50 seats in the room, and I cannot increase
  the cap further.  So if you are not planning to stick with the class,
  please don't wait to formally drop!

\item
  I got off to a slow start, but I will typically try to post notes for
  each lecture before the lecture itself (though maybe only the morning
  of the lecture).  The notes are on GitHub, so if you find errors,
  please feel free to help me correct them.

\item
  The notes for the first lecture include some material that I did not
  talk about explicitly: recommendations for reading in linear algebra
  and numerical linear algebra to supplement what I cover in class,
  and a long list of notational conventions that I plan to follow in class
  and in the notes.

\end{enumerate}
