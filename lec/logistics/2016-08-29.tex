\begin{itemize}
\item General announcement: we are switching from weekly to bi-weekly
  homeworks (mostly because the course is much bigger than planned).
\item If you want to do HW but are not formally enrolled, send me
  email to add you to CMS.
\item Piazza will be set up today (not yet).
\end{itemize}
