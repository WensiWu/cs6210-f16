Cornell's CS 6210 is a graduate course on matrix computations
that is taken by students from a variety of disciplines across
the university.  The most famous instructor is Charlie Van Loan,
and his book (together with Gene Golub) serves as a text when
Charlie teaches the class.  But {\em Matrix Computations} is
encyclopedic in scope, and I always find myself using it as
a reference rather than a textbook when I teach.  And while
I love Demmel's {\em Applied Numerical Linear Algebra} and Trefethen
and Bau's {\em Numerical Linear Algebra}, I find that I again prefer
to read from them than to teach from them.

This file represents my own course notes from teaching CS 6210.
They are a collection of lectures, presented much as I present
them but with some of the logistical details trimmed off.
They are meant as a consolidated study guide for the students
taking the course with me; if they prove of use to another
reader, please let me know!
