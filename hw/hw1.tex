\hdr{HW 1}

You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: A problem of performance}
\matlab\ supports both sparse and dense matrix data structures,
and they have different performance characteristics.  For a variety
of square matrices of size $n$ and sparsity level $s$ (where $s$ is
the fraction of entries that are nonzero), compare the speed of dense
and sparse matrix-vector multiply.  You may use {\tt As = sparse(A)}
to make a sparse version of a dense matrix $A$.  What do you observe
about the relative performance of these options?

{\em Note:} Your performance will vary depending on your machine and
\matlab\ version.  Feel free to write these experiments using
Octave, Python, or Julia if you prefer.
