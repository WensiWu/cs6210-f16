<h3 id="catalog-description">Catalog description</h3>

<p>4 credits.  Introduction to the fundamentals of numerical
linear algebra: direct and iterative methods for linear systems,
eigenvalue problems, singular value decomposition. In the second half
of the course, the above are used to build iterative methods for
nonlinear systems and for multivariate optimization. Strong emphasis
is placed on understanding the advantages, disadvantages, and limits
of applicability for all the covered techniques. Computer programming
is required to test the theoretical concepts throughout the
course.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Linear algebra at the level of <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~web2210/">MATH 2210</a> or <a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/~bterrell/2940/">2940</a>
or equivalent and a CS 1 course in any language.  We will assume you
remember your calculus and can pick up MATLAB.  Recommended but not
essential: one additional mathematics course numbered 3000 or above.
This course can be taken before or after <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Courses/CS4210/2014fa/">CS 4210/MATH 4250</a>.</p>

<h2 id="course-work">Course work</h2>

<h3 id="readings-and-the-proble-du-jour">Readings and the proble du jour</h3>

<p>Readings from the course text (or notes) will be listed on the course
page before class.  <em>You are responsible for reading before lecture</em>.</p>

<p>For most lectures, there will be a “problem of the day” related to
the class material.  These problems are not graded, but you should
try them (and try to understand them) as a way to better learn the
material – and as a way to study for the exams.</p>

<h3 id="participation-and-feedback">Participation and feedback</h3>

<p>Your participation makes the class more interesting and useful
for all of us.  There are several ways to participate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Answering questions in class</li>
  <li>Actively engaging and answering questions on Piazza</li>
  <li>Helping correct and clarify class notes and assignments</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also critical for us to have your feedback about how the class
is going, both to improve the class for the current semester and to
make the class better for future semesters.  We will solicit
non-anonymous comments around the midterm, and at the end of the
semester will check with the college to see who has completed course
evaluation surveys (though we obviously cannot check to see whether
your feedback is useful!).  Participating in these feedback activities
counts toward your grade.</p>

<p>Together, participation and feedback counts for the equivalent of one
homework.</p>

<h3 id="homework-and-projects">Homework and projects</h3>

<p>There will be six one-week homeworks, assigned Friday and due the
following Friday.  These problems will involve a mix of short answers,
plots, and computations done in MATLAB.  Homework should be typed and
submitted as PDF files on CMS.  After they are graded, homework scores
will be posted to CMS.  Regrade requests must be submitted within one
week of receiving the graded homework.</p>

<p>There will be three two-week programming projects, to be done either
alone or in a group of two.  Projects will involve solving a larger
problem, and may be done in either MATLAB or Python.  For projects,
you will need to submit both codes and a writeup PDF file on CMS.</p>

<p>In order to provide timely, high-quality feedback, we may <em>not</em> always
grade all problems in a homework or pieces to a project.  Instead, we
will focus our grading efforts on providing feedback on a few key
points.  We will provide written solutions so that you can evaluate
yourself for problems where we do not grade in detail.</p>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

<p>There will be one midterm and one final exam:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take-Home Midterm: March 7-11</li>
  <li>Final Exam: Thurs, May 19 at 9am.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final is closed book, but you may bring one letter-sized piece
of paper with writing on both sides.</p>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<p>Your final grade in CS 4220 will be computed from grades on the
assignments and exams using the following weights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participation: 5%</li>
  <li>Homework: 5% times 6 homeworks</li>
  <li>Projects: 10% times 3 projects</li>
  <li>Midterm: 15%</li>
  <li>Final: 20%</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course policies</h2>

<h3 id="late-work-policy">Late work policy</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, all work is due by 11:59 pm on the due date.
All homework and projects should be submitted via the course
management system (CMS); you are encouraged to submit early versions,
since resubmissions up to the deadline are counted without penalty.
For each assignment, up to three “slip days” are allowed.  Over the
semester, you may use a total of ten slip days.  You may not use slip
days for the take-home midterm.</p>

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>

<p>An assignment is an academic document, like a journal article.
When you turn it in, you are claiming everything in it is your
original work, <em>unless you cite a source for it</em>.</p>

<p>You are welcome to discuss homework and projects among yourselves in
general terms.  However, you should not look at code or writeups from
other students, or allow other students to see your code or writeup,
even if the general solution was worked out together.  Unless we
explicitly allow it on an assignment, we will not credit code or
writeups that are shared between students (or teams, in the case of
projects).</p>

<p>If you get an idea from a classmate, the TA, a book or other published
source, or elsewhere, please provide an appropriate citation.  This is
not only critical to maintaining academic integrity, but it is also an
important way for you to give credit to those who have helped you out.
When in doubt, cite!  Code or writeups with appropriate citations will
never be considered a violation of academic integrity in this class
(though you will not receive credit for code or writeups that were
shared when you should have done them yourself).</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>We expect academic integrity from everyone.  School is stressful,
and you may feel pressure from your coursework or other factors,
but that is no reason for dishonesty!  If you feel you can’t complete
the work on the own, come talk to the professor, the TA, or your advisor,
and we can help you figure out what to do.</p>

<p>For more information, see Cornell’s 
<a href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Code of Academic Integrity</a>.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-procedures">Emergency procedures</h3>

<p>In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a
revised semester calendar or other circumstances.  Any such announcements will
be posted to <a href="index.html">the course home page</a>.</p>
